# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 24 Dec 2024

## 1. Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Link Pedant ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use its features within Discord servers ("Guilds"). By using the Bot, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information Collected

The Bot processes the following types of data:

- **Messages Sent in Guilds:** The Bot reads all messages in a Guild where it has access, specifically to identify links for proper embedding.
- **Links Processed:** The Bot logs the links it processes for functionality and diagnostic purposes.
- **Debug Logging:** When debug logging is enabled (not used in production by default), message contents may be temporarily logged to diagnose issues or improve functionality. Debug logs are not stored permanently and are deleted after resolving the issues.

## 3. How Information is Used

The data collected is used for:

- Improving the functionality of the Bot by ensuring links are properly embedded.
- Diagnosing and resolving technical issues when debug logging is enabled.
- Monitoring performance and usage trends (aggregated and anonymized).

## 4. Data Retention

- Processed links are retained temporarily in logs to monitor performance and detect issues. These logs are purged periodically.
- Debug logs (if enabled) are only used for temporary diagnostic purposes and are deleted after issues are resolved.

## 5. Sharing of Information

We do not share collected data with third parties unless required by law or to protect the security, integrity, or functionality of the Bot.

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect the data processed by the Bot. However, no security system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data.

## 7. Your Responsibilities

As a Guild administrator, it is your responsibility to:

- Inform members about the presence and functionality of the Bot.
- Ensure that users understand how the Bot interacts with messages and data in your Guild.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with the updated effective date, and continued use of the Bot after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## 9. Contact Us

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at @Jeansburger on Discord.
